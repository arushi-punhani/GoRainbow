## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`:

	- Use a descriptive branch name, e.g. `feature/add-gradient` or `fix/color-parse`.

2. Make small, focused commits. Keep changes well-scoped and documented.

3. Push your branch and open a pull request against the `main` branch. In your PR description include:
	- A short summary of the change
	- Motivation and context (why this change is needed)
	- Any issues fixed (link to issue using `#<number>` when applicable)
	- Notes on backward-incompatible changes, if any

## Branching & pull request process

- Work off `main`. Feature branches should be short-lived.
- Open a pull request and request review from maintainers.

Maintainters will merge once the change is approved.

## Commit messages

Follow a simple, consistent style:

- Use a short (<50 chars) summary on the first line.
- Leave a blank line followed by a longer description when necessary.
- Reference issues with `#<number>` and mention breaking changes explicitly.

## Reporting issues

- Use the repository's Issues tab to report bugs or request features.
- Provide a minimal reproduction, environment details, and expected vs actual behavior.

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to follow a respectful, inclusive Code of Conduct. Be kind and professional in discussions, remarks, and reviews.

If you'd like to contribute and have questions, open an issue or reach out in the repository.
